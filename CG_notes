# Pixel : It is the smallest unit in a digital display
	{pix -> picture , el -> element}

# Opengl : it is a cross platform, hardware accelerating, language independent, industrial standard API for producing 2D and 3D graphics.
    -> consists of 3 set of libraries:
    	1. GL : (core openGL) consists of 100 of commands
    	2. GLU : opengl utility library
    	3. GLUT : opengl utility toolkit
    	
# Resolution (WxH) : it is the number of pixels that appear from top to bottom and left to right.
1. Image resolution : spacing between the pixels {density of the pixels in the image}
2. screen resolution : number of distinct pixels

# PPI (pixels per inch) 

# Aspect ratio : W/H (Number of pixels horizontally to the number of pixels vertically)

# Frame buffer : intensity value of the images we want to display is stored in this memory area { FB = Resolution x bits per pixel}

_______________________________________

# Antialiasing : it is the technique used in computer graphics to remove the aliasing effect.
	-> The aliasing effect is the appearance of jagged edges in the rasterized image. {image rendered using pixels}
	-> jagged edges occurs due to distortion of the image when scan conversion is done at low frequency {undersampling}.


# scan display : it is a technique used for producing images on the screen.

1. Vector scan display : beam is directed to the area on the screen where the picture is to be drawn.
			-> display buffer memory : contains the commands for point or line drawing along with the (x,y) coordinates.
			-> need to refresh atleast 30-60 times per second i.e. 30-60 fps
		=> higher resolution than raster scan display
		=> produces smooth line
		=> need less memory to store picture definition
	# can't draw realistic images
	# max 4 colors only
	# depends how deep the beam penetrates

2. Raster scan display :

# 2D transformation:
Transformation means a change in either position or size or shape or orientation of any graphical object.

-> Representation of points:
A point is represented in 2D by its coordinates, these two values are specified as the elements of a one row, two column matrix

-> Transformation and matrixes:
  [A] [T] = [B]
  => [T] = [A]-1 [B]   {geometric operator matrix}
  
	-> Types of transformation in 2D graphics:
	1. Translation 
	2. Scaling
	3. Rotation
	4. Reflection
	5. Shearing


________________________________________________________


-> When a general 2 x 2 matrix is used to generate a pair of intersecting lines then the result is also a pair of intersecting lines.


If a solution to this pair of equation exists then the line intersect, if not then they are parallel.

# Rendering: It is the process of transforming a 3D virtual scene into 2D images or videos that can be displayed on the screen.
